This is a sample Terraform template for AWS. 

I will use the tools Terrafor + LocalStack + AWS + DockerCompose to make a local aws infrastraction sample for one Node (Kubernetes node) 

Step 1 : Create an IAM in AWS. Where IAM can be located in a single folder. Since, the change of IAM won't affect other resources.
